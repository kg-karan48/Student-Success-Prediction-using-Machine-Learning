## Student-Success-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning


##Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will Pass or Fail based on academic, lifestyle, and accessibility factors using Machine Learning.
The goal is to help educators and institutions identify at-risk students early and take preventive actions.


##Problem Statement
Can we predict student academic success using factors like:
Study hours
Attendance
Past academic performance
Sleep duration
Internet accessibility?


##Solution Approach
Data loading & inspection
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing
Feature scaling
Model training using Logistic Regression
Model evaluation
Real-time user input prediction


##Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
